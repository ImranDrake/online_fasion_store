Thank you for using Makent!

These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement ("Agreement") between you and Makent (as defined below) governing your access to and use of the Makent website, including any subdomains thereof, and any other websites through which Makent makes its services available (collectively, "Site"), our mobile, tablet and other smart device applications, and application program interfaces (collectively, "Application") and all associated services (collectively, "Makent Services"). The Site, Application and Makent Services together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Makent Platform”. 

When these Terms mention “Makent,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the Makent you are contracting with. Account as determined by either your express selection or by Makent’s assessment of your residence using various data attributes associated with your Makent Account.

Our collection and use of personal information in connection with your access to and use of the Makent Platform is described in our Privacy Policy.


1. Scope of Makent Services

1.1 The Makent Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (“Members”) and certain third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services are “Hosts” and the services they offer are “Host Services”) to publish such Host Services on the Makent Platform (“Listings”) and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to book such Host Services (Members using Host Services are “Guests”). Host Services may include the offering of vacation or other properties for use ("Accommodations"), single or multi-day activities in various categories (“Experiences”), access to unique events and locations (“Events”), and a variety of other travel and non-travel related services.

1.2 As the provider of the Makent Platform, Makent does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Listings or Host Services, nor is Makent an organiser or retailer of travel packages. Hosts alone are responsible for their Listings and Host Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. Makent is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members, nor is Makent a real estate broker or insurer. Makent is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms.

1.3 While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, Makent has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. Makent does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any references to a Member being "verified" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Makent about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in an Accommodation, participate in an Experience or Event or use other Host Services, accept a booking request from a Guest, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. Verified Images (as defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by Makent of any Host or Listing.

1.4 If you choose to use the Makent Platform as a Host or Co-Host (as defined below), your relationship with Makent is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of Makent for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of Makent. Makent does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under these Terms specifically, including in connection with your provision of the Host Services. You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion whether to list Host Services or otherwise engage in other business or employment activities.

1.5 To promote the Makent Platform and to increase the exposure of Listings to potential Guests, Listings and other Member Content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements. To assist Members who speak different languages, Listings and other Member Content may be translated, in whole or in part, into other languages. Makent cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such translations. The Makent Platform may contain translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties for merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

1.6 The Makent Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“Third-Party Services”). Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. Makent is not responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by Makent of such Third-Party Services.

1.7 Due to the nature of the Internet, Makent cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility of the Makent Platform. Makent may restrict the availability of the Makent Platform or certain areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the Makent Platform. Makent may improve, enhance and modify the Makent Platform and introduce new Makent Services from time to time.


2. Eligibility, Using the Makent Platform, Member Verification

2.1 You must be at least 18 years old and able to enter into legally binding contracts to access and use the Makent Platform or register an Makent Account. By accessing or using the Makent Platform you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older and have the legal capacity and authority to enter into a contract.

2.3 Makent may make access to and use of the Makent Platform, or certain areas or features of the Makent Platform, subject to certain conditions or requirements, such as completing a verification process, meeting specific quality or eligibility criteria, meeting Ratings or Reviews thresholds, or a Member’s booking and cancellation history.

2.4 User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s identity. 

2.5 The access to or use of certain areas and features of the Makent Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the Makent Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise.

2.6 If you access or download the Application from the Apple App Store, you agree to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement. Some areas of the Makent Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service.


3. Modification of these Terms

Makent reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to these Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the Makent Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. We will also provide you with notice of the modifications by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will inform you about your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email. If you do not terminate your Agreement before the date the revised Terms become effective, your continued access to or use of the Makent Platform will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.


4. Account Registration

4.1 You must register an account ("Makent Account") to access and use certain features of the Makent Platform, such as publishing or booking a Listing. If you are registering an Makent Account for a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to legally bind that entity and grant us all permissions and licenses provided in these Terms.

4.2 You can register an Makent Account using an email address and creating a password, or through your account with certain third-party social networking services, such as Facebook or Google ("SNS Account"). You have the ability to disable the connection between your Makent Account and your SNS Account at any time, by accessing the "Settings" section of the Makent Platform.

4.3 You must provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and keep your Makent Account and public Makent Account profile page information up-to-date at all times.

4.4 You may not register more than one (1) Makent Account unless Makent authorizes you to do so. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Makent Account to another party.

4.5 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Makent Account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party. You must immediately notify Makent if you know or have any reason to suspect that your credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Makent Account. You are liable for any and all activities conducted through your Makent Account, unless such activities are not authorized by you and you are not otherwise negligent (such as failing to report the unauthorized use or loss of your credentials).

4.6 Makent may enable features that allow you to authorize other Members or certain third parties to take certain actions that affect your Makent Account. For example, we may allow eligible Members or certain third parties to book Listings on behalf of other Members, or we may allow Hosts to add other Members as Co-Hosts (as defined below) to help manage their Listings. These features do not require that you share your credentials with any other person. No third party is authorized by Makent to ask for your credentials, and you shall not request the credentials of another Member.


5. Content

5.1 Makent may, at its sole discretion, enable Members to (i) create, upload, post, send, receive and store content, such as text, photos, audio, video, or other materials and information on or through the Makent Platform ("Member Content"); and (ii) access and view Member Content and any content that Makent itself makes available on or through the Makent Platform, including proprietary Makent content and any content licensed or authorized for use by or through Makent from a third party ("Makent Content" and together with Member Content, "Collective Content").

5.2 Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Makent grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to (i) download and use the Application on your personal device(s); and (ii) access and view any Collective Content made available on or through the Makent Platform and accessible to you, solely for your personal and non-commercial use.


6. Service Fees

6.1 Makent may charge fees to Hosts ("Host Fees") and/or Guests ("Guest Fees") (collectively, "Service Fees") in consideration for the use of the Makent Platform. More information about when Service Fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our Service Fees page.

6.2 Any applicable Service Fees (including any applicable Taxes) will be displayed to a Host or Guest prior to publishing or booking a Listing. Makent reserves the right to change the Service Fees at any time, and will provide Members adequate notice of any fee changes before they become effective.

6.3 You are responsible for paying any Service Fees that you owe to Makent. The applicable Service Fees (including any applicable Taxes) are collected by Makent Payments. Makent Payments will deduct any Host Fees from the Listing Fee before remitting the payout to the Host. Any Guest Fees are included in the Total Fees collected by Makent Payments. Except as otherwise provided on the Makent Platform, Service Fees are non-refundable.


8.2 Booking Accommodations

8.2.1 You understand that a confirmed booking of an Accommodation (“Accommodation Booking”) is a limited license granted to you by the Host to enter, occupy and use the Accommodation for the duration of your stay, during which time the Host (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law) retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation, in accordance with your agreement with the Host.

8.2.2 You agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Host specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Host. If you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host's consent (“Overstay”), you no longer have a license to stay in the Accommodation and the Host is entitled to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law. In addition, you agree to pay, if requested by the Host, for each twenty-four (24) hour period (or any portion thereof) that you Overstay, an additional nightly fee of up to two (2) times the average nightly Listing Fee originally paid by you to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Host, plus all applicable Guest Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make you leave (collectively, "Overstay Fees"). Overstay Fees for late checkouts on the checkout date that do not impact upcoming bookings may be limited to the additional costs incurred by the Host as a result of such Overstay. If you Overstay at an Accommodation, you authorize Makent (via Makent Payments) to charge you to collect Overstay Fees. A Security Deposit, if required by a Host, may be applied to any Overstay Fees due for a Guest’s Overstay.


8.3 Booking Experiences, Events and other Host Services

8.3.1 You should carefully review the description of any Experience, Event or other Host Service you intend to book to ensure you (and any additional guests you are booking for) meet any minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements which the Host has specified in their Listing. At your sole discretion you may want to inform the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your and any additional guest’s ability to participate in any Experience, Event or other Host Service. In addition, certain laws, like the minimum legal drinking age in the location of the Experience, Event or other Host Service, may also apply. You are responsible for identifying, understanding, and complying with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your participation in an Experience, Event or other Host Service.

8.3.2 Before and during an Experience, Event or other Host Service you must at all times adhere to the Hosts’ instructions.

8.3.3 You may not bring any additional individuals to an Experience, Event or other Host Service unless such an individual was added by you as an additional guest during the booking process on the Makent Platform.

8.4 Makent Travel Credits

Makent Travel Credits may be redeemed for eligible bookings via the Makent Platform as specified in the terms and conditions provided with the Travel Credit. You may only redeem Makent Travel Credits after the Makent Travel Credits are reflected in your Makent Account.


9. Booking Modifications, Cancellations and Refunds, Resolution Center

9.1 Hosts and Guests are responsible for any modifications to a booking that they make via the Makent Platform or direct Makent customer service to make ("Booking Modifications"), and agree to pay any additional Listing Fees, Host Fees or Guest Fees and/or Taxes associated with such Booking Modifications.

9.2 Guests can cancel a confirmed booking at any time pursuant to the Listing’s cancellation policy, and Makent Payments will refund the amount of the Total Fees due to the Guest in accordance with such cancellation policy. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, any portion of the Total Fees due to the Host under the applicable cancellation policy will be remitted to the Host by Makent Payments pursuant to the Payments Terms.

9.3 If a Host cancels a confirmed booking, the Guest will receive a full refund of the Total Fees for such booking within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation. In some instances, Makent may allow the Guest to apply the refund to a new booking, in which case Makent Payments will credit the amount against the Guest’s subsequent booking at the Guest’s direction. Further, Makent may publish an automated review on the Listing cancelled by the Host indicating that a booking was cancelled. In addition, Makent may (i) keep the calendar for the Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, and/or (ii) impose a cancellation fee, unless the Host has a valid reason for cancelling the booking pursuant to Makent’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy or has legitimate concerns about the Guest’s behavior.

9.4 For Experiences, Events and other Host Services, if inclement weather creates an unsafe or uncomfortable scenario for Guests, Hosts may modify or cancel a Host Service. If there is a substantial change in the itinerary or the Host Service needs to be cancelled, Makent will work with the Host and/or Guests to provide Guests an alternative date for the Host Service, an appropriate refund or a rebooking.

9.5 In certain circumstances, Makent may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking and make appropriate refund and payout decisions. This may be for reasons set forth in Makent's Extenuating Circumstances Policy or (i) where Makent believes in good faith, while taking the legitimate interests of both parties into account, this is necessary to avoid significant harm to Makent, other Members, third parties or property, or (ii) for any of the reasons set out in these Terms.

9.6 If a Guest suffers a Travel Issue pursuant to the Guest Refund Policy, Makent may determine, in its sole discretion, to refund the Guest part or all of the Total Fees in accordance with the Guest Refund Policy.

9.7 If, as a Host, your Guest cancels a confirmed booking or Makent decides that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking, and Makent issues a refund to the Guest in accordance with the Guest Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, or other applicable cancellation policy, you agree that in the event you have already been paid, Makent Payments will be entitled to recover the amount of any such refund from you, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Payouts due to you.

9.8 Except as otherwise set out in these Terms, Members may use the Resolution Center to send or request money for refunds, additional Host Services, Co-Host Services or Damage Claims related to bookings. You agree to pay all amounts sent through the Resolution Center in connection with your Makent Account, and Makent Payments will handle all such payments.


10. Ratings and Reviews

10.1 Within a certain time frame after completing a booking, Guests and Hosts can leave a public review (“Review”) and submit a star rating (“Rating”) about each other. Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinions of individual Members and do not reflect the opinion of Makent. Ratings and Reviews are not verified by Makent for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.

10.2 Members are prohibited from manipulating the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner, such as instructing a third party to write a positive or negative Review about another Member.

10.3Ratings and Reviews are part of a Member’s public profile and may also be surfaced elsewhere on the Makent Platform (such as the Listing page) together with other relevant information such as number of bookings, number of cancellations, average response time and other information.


11. Damage to Accommodations, Disputes between Members

As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation (including any personal or other property located at the Accommodation) in the condition it was in when you arrived. You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation, excluding the Host (and the individuals the Host invites to the Accommodation, if applicable).</p>
